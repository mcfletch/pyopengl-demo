# PyOpenGL's Demos 

This repository is a collection of demo scripts which have been 
contributed to the PyOpenGL project over the last 25 years or so.

Most of the scripts are small, single-feature apps that show 
how to accomplish a particular effect.

## Included Demos

* [da/dots.py](da/dots.py) -- mutate array used to render data as points
* [NeHe/*.py](NeHe/) -- some of NeHe (Richard Campbell)'s 2000-era tutorials converted to Python by John Ferguson then ported again by Tarn Weisner Burton
* [proesch/*](proesch/) -- tutorials from Peter Roesch on modern features circa 2004
* [tom/*.py](tom/) -- Tom's (which I believe is a reference to Thomas Schwaller) original demos for Tk from the PyOpenGL 1.5 releases (1998-ish)
* [GLUT/tom/*.py](GLUT/tom/) -- Tom's original demos ported to run under GLUT 
* [GLUT/*.py](GLUT/) -- GLGears-alike, Demo with GLUT menus, shader sample
* [redbook/*.py](redbook/) -- Jason L. Petrone's porting of RedBook demos (core concepts)
* [GLE/*.py](GLE/) -- Tests/demos of GL Extrusion library (GLE) features
* [dek/*.py](dek/) -- Demos from David Konerding showing PIL integration
