# Ported to PyOpenGL 2.0 by Tarn Weisner Burton 10May2001
#
# This code was created by Richard Campbell '99 (ported to Python/PyOpenGL by John Ferguson 2000)
#
# The port was based on the PyOpenGL tutorial module: dots.py  
#
# If you've found this code useful, please let me know (email John Ferguson at hakuin@voicenet.com).
#
# See original source and C based tutorial at http://nehe.gamedev.net
#
# Note:
# -----
# This code is not a good example of Python and using OO techniques.  It is a simple and direct
# exposition of how to use the Open GL API in Python via the PyOpenGL package.  It also uses GLUT,
# which in my opinion is a high quality library in that it makes my work simpler.  Due to using
# these APIs, this code is more like a C program using function based programming (which Python
# is in fact based upon, note the use of closures and lambda) than a "good" OO program.
#
# To run this code get and install OpenGL, GLUT, PyOpenGL (see http://www.python.org), and PyNumeric.
# Installing PyNumeric means having a C compiler that is configured properly, or so I found.  For 
# Win32 this assumes VC++, I poked through the setup.py for Numeric, and chased through disutils code
# and noticed what seemed to be hard coded preferences for VC++ in the case of a Win32 OS.  However,
# I am new to Python and know little about disutils, so I may just be not using it right.
#
# BTW, since this is Python make sure you use tabs or spaces to indent, I had numerous problems since I 
# was using editors that were not sensitive to Python.
