These demos were graciously re-licensed by Peter Roesch
under the PyOpenGL license to allow inclusion in the 
PyOpenGL-Demo package.  The demos include reasonably 
high-level effects such as nurbs, shaders, interaction and 
stereo rendering.

bezier
	Deforming surface modeled by bezier patches.	
colorCube
	Rotating color cube using vertex arrays.
interactionMatrix
	interactively modify translation/rotation matrix (glut)
nurbs
	Animated NURBS surface with two holes generated by trimming. 
nurbsCurve
	Difference between a circular NURBS curve and a NURBS curve
	with control points positioned on a circle.
shaderProg
	Helper class to simplify the use of GLSL programs from
	python programs with two demos.
simple
	Simple Quad, animation and interaction samples (glut)
simpleTexture
	Load a texture from a file using PIL and map it to a quad.
stereo
	Helper class for stereo rendering and an example using
	either anaglyphs or quad buffer stereo (e.g. shutter glasses).
