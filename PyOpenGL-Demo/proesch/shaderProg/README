brick.frag
	3DLabs shader for procedural bricks
brick.vert
	3DLabs Vertex shader for procedural bricks extended to 
	perform deformation of a torus
shaderProg.py
	Python class to simplify the incorporation of GLSL programs into
	applications. In particular, methods for loading, compiling
	and linking shader programs are provided as well as methods to get
	the indices of uniform variables and vertex attributes.
	See textureShader.py and torusShader.py for sample applications.
rgbMorph.frag
	Fragment shader program that transforms rgb vectors.
textureShader.py
	Demo that loads a texture from file and multiplies the rgb
	colors with a randomly varying transformation matrix.
torusShader.py
	Demo showing a torus with time varying deformation
	(brick.vert) and a brick pattern (brick.frag)
